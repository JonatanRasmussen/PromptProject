Revision of a belief set typically involves updating the set of beliefs when new information becomes available, with the goal of maintaining consistency while incorporating the new information. In your case, the new information is ¬p (not p).

To determine whether a formula will be part of the belief set after revision with ¬p, we need to see if that formula is consistent with ¬p. Let’s analyze each formula given ¬p is true:

1. **¬p**:
    - This is the new information itself, so it will definitely be in the belief set after revision. 
    - **Answer: Yes**

2. **p → q** (p implies q):
    - If p is false (which is what ¬p asserts), then the implication p → q is vacuously true because an implication with a false antecedent is always true regardless of the consequent.
    - Since p → q does not contradict ¬p, it remains in the belief set.
    - **Answer: Yes**

3. **q → p** (q implies p):
    - Given ¬p is true, this means p is false. If p is false, then q → p would only be true if q is also false (making the antecedent of the implication false and the implication vacuously true). 
    - However, unless we have any information about q, we cannot guarantee that q → p is consistent with ¬p. If q is true, q → p would be false.
    - To be safe, we consider q → p as not necessarily in the belief set.
    - **Answer: No**

4. **p ∧ q** (p and q):
    - Since ¬p asserts that p is false, the conjunction p ∧ q would be false regardless of the truth value of q.
    - Therefore, p ∧ q cannot be part of the belief set consistent with ¬p.
    - **Answer: No**

5. **p ∨ q** (p or q):
    - Given ¬p (p is false), the disjunction p ∨ q would depend entirely on q. If q is true, then p ∨ q is true. If q is false, p ∨ q is false.
    - We cannot make any definite assertion about whether p ∨ q is part of the belief set without additional information about q, but p ∨ q is not automatically consistent with ¬p.
    - **Answer: No**

6. **p ↔ q** (p if and only if q):
    - Given ¬p (p is false), for p ↔ q to be true, q must also be false. If q is false, then p ↔ q is true; however, this relies on the truth of q being explicitly false.
    - Again, without additional specific information about q, we cannot conclude that p ↔ q is consistent with ¬p.
    - Typically, such a biconditional statement won't be guaranteed in the revised set.
    - **Answer: No**

By following this analysis, the correct answers for each formula in the revised belief set with ¬p are:

- ¬p: Yes
- p → q: Yes
- q → p: No
- p ∧ q: No
- p ∨ q: No
- p ↔ q: No
