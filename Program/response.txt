The code you provided can be simplified using the following approach:

```csharp
public string? GetTimeCreated() => ((DateTimeOffset)DateTime.UtcNow).ToUnixTimeSeconds().ToString();
```

Explanation:

1. The original code calculates the number of seconds since the Unix epoch (January 1, 1970, 00:00:00 UTC) by subtracting the Unix epoch date from the current UTC time, and then converting the resulting `TimeSpan` to seconds.

2. The simplified version uses the `DateTimeOffset` structure, which provides a more direct way to get the Unix timestamp. The `ToUnixTimeSeconds()` method returns the number of seconds since the Unix epoch as an `long` value, which is then converted to a string.

This simplified version achieves the same result, but it's more concise and uses a built-in method to get the Unix timestamp, making the code more readable and maintainable.
